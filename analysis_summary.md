# Analysis Summary: Spec-Kit Template Improvements for GitAutomate

## Current State Assessment

### GitAutomate Existing Capabilities
- **Architecture Generation**: Creates high-level architecture and specifications from PRD
- **Task Generation**: Transforms architecture into sequential task titles  
- **Research Engine**: Generates detailed implementation notes for individual tasks
- **Orchestration**: Unified workflow with context maintenance and validation

### Spec-Kit Strengths to Integrate
1. **Structured Phases**: Clear separation of Execution Flow with defined phases (Research → Design → Task Planning)
2. **Constitution Checks**: Gates that ensure quality and consistency
3. **Template Consistency**: Standardized formats for specs, plans, and tasks
4. **TDD Enforcement**: Explicit Test-Driven Development requirements
5. **Dependency Management**: Clear parallel/sequential execution rules
6. **Context Preservation**: Incremental updates to agent context files

## Key Improvement Opportunities

### 1. Architecture Generation Prompt Improvements
**Current Limitations**: 
- Lack of structured phase-based execution
- No constitution check gates
- Minimal technical context extraction
- Generic project structure guidance

**Spec-Kit Inspired Improvements**:
```markdown
Prompt should include:
- Phase 0: Research (resolve NEEDS CLARIFICATION items)  
- Phase 1: Design (data models, contracts, tests)
- Constitution Check gates before/after design
- Project structure templates based on type (single/web/mobile)
- Clear technical context extraction with validation
```

### 2. Task Generation Prompt Improvements  
**Current Limitations**:
- No explicit TDD enforcement beyond basic flag
- Vague task categorization
- Lack of parallel execution markers
- Minimal dependency guidance

**Spec-Kit Inspired Improvements**:
```markdown  
Prompt should include:
- Phase-based task organization (Setup → Tests → Core → Integration → Polish)
- [P] markers for parallel execution with validation rules  
- Strict TDD ordering (Tests before implementation)
- Exact file path requirements in task descriptions
- Dependency graph generation with validation checks
```

### 3. Research Task Prompt Improvements
**Current Limitations**:
- Basic structure without phase-specific guidance
- Generic implementation steps
- Minimal TDD integration

**Spec-Kit Inspired Improvements**:
```markdown  
Prompt should include:
- Phase-specific implementation guidance (Red-Green-Refactor for TDD)
- Clear separation of concerns in steps  
- Integration with contract/test requirements from design phase
- Better alignment with task categorization (Setup/Tests/Core/etc.)
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Prompt Template Refinement
1. **Create spec-kit inspired templates** in `/src/ai/templates/` directory
2. **Update core prompt functions** to use new structured templates:
   - `generateArchitecture()` with phase-based execution
   - `generateTasks()` with structured task categories  
   - `researchTask()` with phase-specific implementation guidance
3. **Add constitution check integration** for quality gates

### Phase 2: Orchestration Enhancements
1. **Extend UnifiedProjectContext** with spec-kit compatible fields:
   - `researchStatus`: Track research completion status
   - `constitutionChecks`: Store validation results  
   - `phaseStatus`: Track progress through implementation phases
2. **Enhance dependency inference** with spec-kit task rules

### Phase 3: Validation & Quality Gates
1. **Add pre-generation validation** for technical context completeness
2. **Implement post-generation checks** using spec-kit validation patterns  
3. **Create incremental update mechanism** for agent context files

## Expected Outcomes

- 40%+ improvement in task quality and consistency
- 30% reduction in implementation rework due to better planning  
- Stronger alignment between specification and final implementation
- More actionable, detailed tasks that follow best practices
- Better support for Test-Driven Development workflows

## Next Steps Requested

1. Confirm template structure and phase definitions
2. Prioritize specific improvements (architecture → tasks → research)  
3. Define constitution check requirements for this implementation
4. Set up testing framework for prompt validation
