const fileStructurePrompt = `You are a senior software architect. Your task is to generate a comprehensive, proposed file and folder structure for a new software project, based on the following Product Requirements Document (PRD), architecture, and specifications.

**Instructions:**
- Carefully analyze the PRD, architecture, and specifications provided below.
- Propose a complete file/folder structure that reflects best practices for the project's stack and requirements.
- Include all major directories, key files, and any configuration or setup files that would be expected at project start.
- Use clear, descriptive names for folders and files.
- If relevant, group related components, utilities, and assets into logical subdirectories.
- Do not include implementation details or codeâ€”only the structure.
- Output the structure as:
  - A markdown code block using tree notation (e.g., \`project-root/\n  src/\n    index.ts\n  README.md\`)
- Make sure the output is easily human-editable and ready for further refinement.
- Do not add any explanations or commentary outside the code block or JSON tree.
- Make sure the proposed tree covers all aspects of the project, including testing, documentation, and configuration, as well as CI/CD if described in the documentation. Do not focus on just one aspect of the project, the folder structure is for the entire project.

**PRD:**
{{{prd}}}

**Architecture:**
{{{architecture}}}

**Specifications:**
{{{specifications}}}

Respond with ONLY the proposed file/folder structure as a markdown code block or JSON tree.
