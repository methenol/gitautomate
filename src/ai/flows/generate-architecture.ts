## Overview
Based on the PRD, here's a proposed software architecture:

### Technology Stack
- Frontend: React/Next.js for the web interface
- Backend: Node.js with Express API server  
- Database: PostgreSQL for structured data storage
- Authentication: JWT-based auth system

### System Architecture
The system will follow a clean architecture pattern with:

1. **Presentation Layer**: React components and Next.js pages
2. **Application Layer**: API routes and business logic
3. **Domain Layer**: Core business entities and rules  
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Database, external APIs, and integrations

### Key Components
- User Management System
- PRD Processing Engine  
- Task Generation Module
- File Structure Generator

### Data Flow
1. User uploads PRD through web interface
2. System validates and parses requirements
3. Architecture generator creates technical specifications
4. Task planner breaks down implementation steps
5. User reviews and approves generated plan`,
    specifications: `# Technical Specifications

## Functional Requirements
1. **PRD Upload**: Support for text-based product requirement documents
2. **Architecture Generation**: Automated software architecture design based on requirements
3. **Task Planning**: Breakdown of implementation into manageable tasks  
4. **File Structure Generation**: Creation of organized project structure
5. **User Review Interface**: Allow users to review and modify generated content

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: Sub-second response times for PRD processing
2. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with proper error handling
3. **Security**: API key encryption and secure user authentication
4. **Scalability**: Support for concurrent users and large PRDs

## API Specifications
- RESTful endpoints for all CRUD operations
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Comprehensive error responses
- Request/response validation

## Database Schema  
Users, PRDs, Architectures, Tasks, and FileStructure tables with proper relationships`
